## 2Reflect Privacy Policy

This application does not collect, store, or transmit personal data to any other system except the 2Reflect web client, which is used to draw/annotate the screen (in case of doubt, that's YOUR other computer).

There are analytics and telemetry data collected internally within the app to help with development - none of that leaves your local network either.  None of this telemetry includes any personal / identity information of any kind whatsoever.  Seriously, we don't really care who you are - we just care that you find this software useful and tell all your friends about it.

Tell all your friends about it.

If you have any questions, contact us at [sales@effective-flow.ch](mailto:sales@effective-flow.ch).
